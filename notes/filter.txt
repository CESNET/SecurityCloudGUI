I!      ip version	//Zmena oproti nfdump - inet <num> alebo ipv <num> 
           inet  or ipv4 for IPv4
           inet6 or ipv6 for IPv6

IT     protocol
           proto <protocol>
           proto <number>
           where <protocol> is known protocol such as tcp, udp, icmp, icmp6, gre, esp, ah, etc.  or  a
           valid protocol number: 6, 17 etc.

IT     IP address	//BEZ DNS prekladu
           [src|dst] ip <ipaddr>
           [src|dst] host <ipaddr>
           with  <ipaddr> as any valid IPv4, IPv6 address, or a full qualified hostname.  In case of a
           hostname, the IP address is looked up in DNS.  If more than a single IP address  is  found,
           all IP addresses are chained together. (ip1 or ip2 or ip3 ... )

           To check if an IP address is in a known IP list, use
           [src|dst] ip in [ <iplist> ]
           [src|dst] host in [ <iplist> ]
           <iplist>  is a space or comma separated list of individual <ipaddr> or full qualified host‐
           names, which are looked up in DNS. If more than a  single  IP  address  is  found,  all  IP
           addresses are put into the list.

       [src|dst]
           IP  addresses,  networks,  ports,  AS  number  etc. can be specifically selected by using a
           direction qualifier, such as src or dst.  They can also be used in combination with and and
           or.  such as src and dst ip ...

IT      network

           must match the appropriate address familiy in IPv4 or IPv6. Networks may be abreviated such
           as 172.16/16 if they are unambiguous.
          
IT     Port
           [src|dst] port [comp] <num>

           Selects source, dstination, previous, next or any AS number with <num> as any valid as num‐
           ber.  32bit  AS numbers are suported. If comp is omitted, '=' is assumed. comp is explained
           more detailed below.

           [src|dst|prev|next] as in [ <ASlist> ]
           An AS number can be compared against a know list, where <ASlist> is a space or comma  sepa‐
           rated list of individual AS numbers.

              U    Urgent.
              X    All flags on.
       The  ordering  of the flags is not relevant. Flags not mentioned are treated as don't care.  In
       order to get those flows with only the SYN flag set, use the syntax  'flags  S  and  not  flags
       AFRPU'.
